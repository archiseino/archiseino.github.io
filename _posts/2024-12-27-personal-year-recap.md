# 2024 in Overview
2024 is almost over and I think it's better for me to recap what's going on I guess look back on see what did I make in the past 1 year interval would be good.

## KKN 
The year started with the KKN, even though my KKN life is flat and there's not much special going on. I working out the chatbot using baileyes and whatsapp api as the project, even though it did not perfect, but I guess I can start probably working on some SAAS later with that.

## Bangkit 
For those didn't know, Basically Bangkit is just a probably like the Studi Independen / Bootcamp stuff with 3 Learning Path, and I choose the Mobile Development because I love OOP and yeah. To be fair also my Bangkit journey is also just being mediocare since I'm only interested in achiving the instant IP 4.0 for my semester. And then oh ya, I also got the Mobile App Certification in here.

## Kerja Praktik (KP) Stuff
My next journey is on the KPU with my collegues Shahih Indra. For the next 45 days, I've spent my days learning about work environment, the democracy within goverment instance and helping for the Pilkada 2024. From what I've experience, I knew that why some people choose want to become and PNS after graduate from this experience. It was fun, but working on the gov it seems not my ideal types.

## New Semester, New Me~~ntal health~~
Well, things took a turn. When I want to take Backend Dev since you really can't work out with the data stream for an app. God has other plan, to let me enjoy my second last semester in Campus, I took my all courses from returned Mr Martin. It opened for me a branch of the new vision about the tech, if I probaly takes the Backend Dev path Studi Independen, I probably get what I want but, I will become an Inshell that only play in the same place over and over again.

## Final Thesis / Script?
Since, I'm takes a regular semester, with the guidence of Mr. Martin I can get my Final Thesis idea. That's something.

# Notes:
Life is a series of event, and I guess this year was pretty overall good for me. Since my nature that just `meh` to anything, probably to my former past and future me. I know I can do better one about stuff and execution from my past experience, but I think there will be a huge obstacles like incompetent friend, huge disaster and stuff so I guess my instict are not wrong.

The project that I've make is basically all just being mediocare, and the pattern that I can see here is just a non-radical friends that I have who can't takes the gamble and for the project. I hate to say this, but if you only have the idea, it will be worthless without the support for the other, and the other basically just being mediocare.

## 2025 Onwards
To be fair, I wouldn't make any non sense planning, since my future me will do the `meh` things like I always did.

But I'll leave a note to my future me, that I guess just do it alone, and keep the spirit of learning that u always have.

Also on the other side, Let's just settle on this objective:
- Let's watch the Jakarta E-Prix again (The last time is just not proper)
- Takes a proper profile photo.
- Just speak Russian, the Duolingo stuff is non-sense after I completed it.

For this year, I rate 9 airplane / 11 nasi padang zaky
